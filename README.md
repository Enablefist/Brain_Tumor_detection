# Brain_Tumor_detection

## Brain tumour detection is to identify the type of tumour in the brain with the help of the 18 layers of CNN. It will show accuracy, and it is a web-based project where the user can just insert an image into the web application, and then it will show the type of tumour with the help of a trained CNN model.
